For this exercise see if you can improve MNIST to 99.5% accuracy or more by adding only a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D layer to the model from the  assignment of the previous week.\n","\n","You should stop training once the accuracy goes above this amount. It should happen in less than 10 epochs, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, but your training must end once it hits the above metric. If it doesn't, then you'll need to redesign your callback.\n","\n","When 99.5% accuracy has been hit, you should print out the string \"Reached 99.5% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"ZpztRwBouwYp","tags":["graded"],"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704008134130,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":12373,"user":{"displayName":"Chaithra K.C","userId":"06590399226295405413"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6jIekQTVx4Fm"},"source":["## Load the data\n","\n","Begin by loading the data.

By default the `load_data` from Keras accepts a path relative to `~/.keras/datasets` but in this case it is stored somewhere else, as a result of this, you need to specify the full path.\n","\n","-

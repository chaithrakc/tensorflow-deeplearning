In the lecture you saw how this was done for the loss but here you will be using accuracy instead.\n","\n","Some notes:\n","1. Your network should succeed in less than 9 epochs.\n","2. When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string \"Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!\" and stop training.\n","3.
